                Hi, I'm Nico. I grew up in Hawaii and spent the first eighteen years of my life there. I moved to Oakland in 2011 and have been working as an IT Manager at Market Hall Foods since then.
                At Market Hall I do all the network security, and make sure that the business is compliant with the payment card industry standards. I also work on six websites representing different businesses owned by Market Hall.
                <br><br>
                In my free time I enjoy playing video games on my self built computer, carving wood with hand tools, and cooking delicious meals. I play a lot of League of Legends with my friends, it's a good way to keep in contact with long distance buddies.
                <br><br>
                I have spent quite some time in my life coding as a hobby, and I enjoy it very much. This will be my first time learning to code in a formal setting and I really look forward to it! One of my favorite things to do is create tools for gaming communities. I hope to be able to use the knowledge from this class to build some really cool things!
